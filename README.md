# FIP - Authoring 1
Exploring Workflow Concepts

## Assignment Description
Each student is required to create a multiple page website based on the HTML/CSS
templates provided in class. The subject of the website is entirely up to the student.
The design must be an HTML5 fixed-width site utilizing CSS-Grid as the primary method of
layout. Refer to the Web and Design classes for the total number of pages.
Students must adhere to the layout set by the template XD file.
Students must use workflow practices as outlined in class - branches, pull requests, merges
etc.

Students must add UX/UI enhancements of their choice using CSS best practices as
demonstrated in class. Use an animation, hover effect, :checked, :selected, ::after, ::before
etc. Use a lightbox, “see more”, virtual content etc.
Include a well-written Readme file as part of your final submission.

# Assignment Requirements

required sections (refer to the example file for reference)

● Use UX/UI enhancements of your choice using CSS best practices as demonstrated

a lightbox, “see more”, virtual content etc. The more the better!

Additional Information
Missed tests/exams will not be rescheduled without some valid evidence of some important
event over which the student has no control (e.g., Court appearance, death in the family).
Missed tests or exams, therefore, can receive a zero. The students are advised to notify the
professor prior to missing the test.

Students are expected to hand in all assignments to the course instructor on the due date,
and all assignments must be submitted in the format specified by the instructor (e.g., on
FOL, in printed form, on a specific lab computer, etc.); assignments will not be accepted in
any format other than that specified.

Late assignments will not be accepted, nor will make up test or assignments be permitted,
without some valid evidence of some important event over which the student has no control
(e.g., documented illness, death in the family). Missed tests or assignments, therefore, will
receive a mark of zero. Late assignments and make-up tests will only be permitted following
the submission of adequate documentation acceptable to the instructor (e.g., a doctor's
note). Students are advised to notify the instructor prior to missing an assignment due date
or a scheduled test.

Immediately upon return from an illness/absence in which a test or assignment has been
missed, the student is responsible for contacting the course instructor to discuss the
problem. The instructor will make arrangements for any student deemed eligible. The
alternative test/assignment will be of equal value to the one missed with no grade penalty.

The timeline and due dates will be determined by the course instructor.

At mid-term, any unsatisfactory results will be reported to the student.
This course may be revised by the professor with suitable notification to the students.
Students are responsible for making arrangements to pick up missed handouts, assignments
and course announcements from classmates.

Plagiarism (e.g., failure to acknowledge sources used, submitting another student's work
under your name, or producing work for another student to submit) is a serious academic
offense that shall result in appropriate penalties, to be determined at the discretion of the
course professor in consultation with the chairperson of the Communication Arts division.
The penalties shall range from failure of an assignment to possible failure of the course.
Students shall not make the assumption that any provision will be made by the professor to
permit the student to rewrite or redo failed assignments.
